     Data type        Mutable    Ordered   Indexing   Duplicate
    
     List [ ]          yes        yes       yes         yes
    
     Tuple ( )         no         yes       yes         yes
    
     Set { }           no         no        no          no
    
     Dictionary        yes        yes       no          no
     { key : value }
     
     
Now what is the usefulness of this cheatsheet?

Using a little logical thinking here we can crack many basic programs like removing duplicates from a list.  
So how is it done you say!  
let me explain

using set() method, that's it  
As we can observe from above,List allow Duplications but Set don't.  
Go to the python file linked in this repo for detailed code.
