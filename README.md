# Python_Data_Structures_Cheat_Sheet

Data type | Mutable|Ordered|Indexing|Duplicate
----------|--------|-------|---------|--------
List [ ] |  yes | yes | yes | yes 
Tuple ( ) |  no | yes | yes | yes
Set { } |  no | no | no | no
Dictionary { key : value } |  yes | yes | no | no


Now what is the whole point of creating the cheatsheet in the first place you ask!

Using a little logical thinking here, anyone can crack many basic programs like removing duplicates from a list.  
So how is it done you say!  
let me explain

using set() method, that's it,  
As we can observe from above,List allow Duplications but Set don't.  
Go to the python file linked in this repo for detailed code.

You can use this to make projects like password generator but with no duplicate characters in it and much more.
