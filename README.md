# Python_Data_Structures_Cheat_Sheet

     
     
Now what is the usefulness of this cheatsheet?

Using a little logical thinking here, anyone can crack many basic programs like removing duplicates from a list.  
So how is it done you say!  
let me explain

using set() method, that's it,  
As we can observe from above,List allow Duplications but Set don't.  
Go to the python file linked in this repo for detailed code.

You can use this to make projects like password generator but with no duplicate characters in it and much more.
